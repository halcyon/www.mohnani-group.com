one of the early leaders of the Indian community in Yokohama, the firm
was responsible for training a significant portion of the executives
of Indian trading companies in the intricacies of international
trade. The firm has been active in the local community serving as
President of the Indian Merchants Association from 1953 to 1955 and
currently as its Treasurer. In addition, the firm has been a member in
good standing of the Yokohama Chamber of Commerce for over 60 years.
